# Grimble

Grimble is a cryptocurrency based on [Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin) with a reduced coinbase emission rate. 

Grin has many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Clean and minimal implementation, aiming to stay as such.
  * Follows the MimbleWimble protocol, which provides great anonymity and scaling characteristics.
  * Cuckoo Cycle proof of work.
  * Relatively fast block time (a minute).
  * Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.
  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.
  * Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.
